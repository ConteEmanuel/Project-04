a calculator with keyboard support and extras

"This is a Browser version of a Calculator with Keyboard Support, also the EXTRA function added for me here is a Night & Black Theme Button.

"All the logic is original made by me,i made 2 objects with numbers and opeators and i susbtract/add elements from them to prevent his use twice, for example, dots, or double "="clicks.Also i take same usefull functionalities for example to allow you if you start a number with zero to change it for another number."

"This Proyect dont use Jquery for CSS Responsive. This one only use Vanilla js, and some html and css".
